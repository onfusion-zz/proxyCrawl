			"reviewTitle": "Absolutely Amazing Value - Some other features not even listed!",
			"reviewText": "This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.",

			"reviewText": "I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.",

I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.",

A few reviews complain about ghosting, which I experienced until I realized in the default settings on the monitors had \"overdrive\" or \"OD\" on. As long as you disable this feature you will no longer have ghosting trouble! Hope this helps anyone who bought these and was disappointed, I saw nothing online about fixing this issue other than figuring it out myself by chance.",

			"reviewTitle": "Extremely Disappointed",
			"reviewText": "I very rarely write reviews, but am so disappointed with this monitor, that I felt the need to warn others. Originally bought this last year to use for school and work. After a few weeks, started having issues with it turning off and repeatedly blinking in mid-use, as well as dead pixels in the middle of the screen. Contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement and I returned the original. Again, a few weeks of perfect operation. Then on the replacement unit, the power and menu buttons stopped working. The only way to turn on and off was to physically unplug the unit. Contacted Amazon again, and they referred me to the manufacturer. After several attempts, I finally got a hold of a person. They said they would look at, but I would have to ship it back on my own dime, and they would not replace it. I declined (mostly because I didn't have a box to pack it in, and was severely unimpressed with customer service).So I continued using it for several months with few issues. I stopped using it earlier this year, mostly because I got tired of the physical unplugging, and started using an old TV instead. Just now, went to fire it up again for my wife to use. After not touching or using it for the last few months, the screen is cracked in the middle, and as far as I'm concerned is unusable. And no, this is not a case of oops I dropped it and now I'm going to blame the hardware. I have other Acer electronics, and have been for the most part satisfied, but this monitor has been nothing but problems. Would rate less than 1 star if possible.",

			"reviewText": "This monitor really knocked my socks off! I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one. I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this. It isn't kidding when they say it is thin. It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much. The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything. But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower. With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image. With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!! It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it. The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness). It has a ton of settings for the monitor. The refresh rate of 75 is nice. I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice. I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work). Well worth the money by far!",

Lo que si me molesta de estos paneles es que ni en la pagina oficial mencionan el echo de que es de 6 bits y no 8, lo cual si marca una gran diferencia en rango dinamico y colores, si de por si 8 bits tiene colores pobres, imaginen 6bits: terribles.Es mi primer monitor y no tengo mucho dinero entonces vale la pena.Eso si estoy impresionado con lo delgado que esta el panel pero en si su diseño no es muy bonito que digamos.",

The two bottom corners have noticeable bright spots that can be a bit distracting when the monitor is displaying darker backgrounds. Overall, I'm giving this monitor 5/5 because it works great. I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.",

La fuente de poder es externa, lo que ahorra costos y ayuda a su estética general.Cumple con todo, el full HD, los 75hz, y es IPS ( no he probado el FreeSYNC, no uso AMD)Pros:+Es muy ligero, facilita mucho la limpieza del escritorio y el transporte.+Costo/beneficio, es de los mejores que puedes encontrar, superando a monitores 1080p60hz+Tiene varios perfiles personalizables y puedes alternar entre ellos fácilmente.+Tiene unos 30 grados de inclinación para mejor visualizaciónCons:-La base es de un plástico ligero y barato. Aunque para el peso del monitor, no necesita más.-Por default tiene un filtro verde muy molesto. Pero Se arregla en 10 minutos corrigiendo el color.-Los botones los tiene en la parte inferior, Cuesta algo de trabajo moverse en el menú a ciegas, y el botón de apagado es igual a todos los demás botones.-Tiene unos bordes negros que hacen parecer que no está dando la resolución total, pero te acostumbras fácilmente.Recomiendo ampliamente este monitor 100%.",

I was surprised that it is so thin and light. In size to me just right. the picture is very juicy and does not bother your eyes, after the old monitors it’s quite nice to see a very colorful picture, the same bonus is that there are 75 hertz and this is REALLY felt in games. Of the minuses, I can only say that in the lower left part of the screen, when the black picture appears, the light is visible there, but this is only when you turn on the black background, and everything is in order. So for the overall impression of delivery and to the quality of the goods, I will put 4.",
